# Oversample

Oversample is a [Renoise][renoise] plugin that (when completed) is supposed to
increase all quality parameters (such as "oversampling", "quality", "phase",
etc.) in all active devices in the song to maximum, so you get the best quality
when rendering a song to WAV.

When rendering is done, Oversample will allow you to turn all quality
parameters back down to minimum to not destroy your CPU while producing.

**NB: Oversample is not in any way complete and can not be used for anything yet.**
